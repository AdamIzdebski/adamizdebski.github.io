Currently, I am a PhD student under [Ewa Szczurek](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~szczurek/) at University of Warsaw. My main focus is to make generative models and large language models useful for molecule and peptide generation. However, I am excited about solving important biological problems with the use of artificial intelligence, e.g. with the use of scRNAseq data, in general.  

Prior to satrting my PhD, I worked on quantum machine learning with [Ronald de Wolf](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/), I interned at [Pacmed Labs](https://pacmed.ai/pacmed-labs/), working on causal inference with [Giovanni Cina`](https://sites.google.com/site/homepagegcina/) and at [MI2 Data Lab](https://www.mi2.ai/), working on explainable AI with [Przemys≈Çaw Biecek](https://pbiecek.github.io/).

As for my background, I studied logic at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) in Amsterdam, obtained a master's degree in mathematics from University of Warsaw and two bachelor's degree in philosophy and quantitative methods in economics.
